## Map Module
This is the code we delivered to a client which business revolves around gardening services. It solves the problem of doing quick price estimations by creating an area(polygon) in the address of the customers of our client.

The code in mapmodule(front end) is written using old react(16.11.0) and the one in MapModuleAPI(API) is written in .net core 3.
